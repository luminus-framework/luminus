Luminus aims to facilitate developing [12 factor](http://12factor.net/) style applications.
The 12 factor approach states that the configuration should be kept separate from the code. The application
should not have to be packaged differently for each environment that it's deployed in.

The environment variables are managed by the [cprop](https://github.com/tolitius/cprop) library.
The configuration is represented by a map. the map is constructed by aggregating variables from
multiple sources in the environment. The sources include EDN configuration, shell variables,
and Java system properties.

### EDN Based Configuration

The library will first look for a `config.edn` file on the resource path. This will be used as the
base configuration for the application. An external configuration file can be specified using the
`conf` Java option at runtime: `-Dconf=prod-config.edn`.

The configuration placed in `config.edn` should consist of a map such as the following:

```clojure
{:port 4000}
```

This configuration will be merged on top of the configuration found on the resource path.
The library uses a deep merge strategy, so any nested structures will be merged intelligently.

### Managing Environment Variables

The `System/getProperties` will be merged on top of the configuration found on the resource path and
the optional EDN configuration file.

```
java -Ddatabase-url="jdbc:postgresql://localhost/app?user=app_user&password=secret" -jar app.jar
```

The variable names are converted into Clojure style keywords. The variables are lowercased and `_`
characters are used to indicate nesting, while `.` characters are converted to `-` charachters.

* `-Dport=300` -> `{:port 3000}`
* `-Dnrepl-port=7000` -> `{:nrepl-port 7000}`
* `-Ddatabase-url="jdbc:h2:./guestbook_dev.db"` -> `{:database-url "jdbc:h2:./guestbook_dev.db"}`
* `-Dio_http.max.connections=10` -> `{:io {:http-max-connections 10}}`

Any environment variables found in `System/getenv` will be merged last. These variables are parsed using the
following strategy:

* `PORT=3000` -> `{:port 3000}`
* `NREPL_PORT=7000` - {:nrepl-port 7000}
* `DATABASE_URL="jdbc:h2:./guestbook_dev.db"` -> `{:database-url "jdbc:h2:./guestbook_dev.db"}`
* `IO__HTTP_MAX_CONNECTIONS` -> `{:io {:http-max-connections 10}}`

Note that the `_` is converted to `-`, while `__` is used to indicate nesting for shell variables. These
conventions can be mixed as seen with `IO__HTTP_MAX_CONNECTIONS`.

See the [official documentation](https://github.com/tolitius/cprop) for further details.

### Default Environment Variables

Luminus projects use the following environment variables by default:

* `PORT` - HTTP port that the application will attempt to bind to, defaults to `3000`
* `NREPL_PORT` - when set the application will run the nREPL server on the specified port, defaults to `7000` for development
* `DATABASE_URL` - the URL for the database connection
* `APP_CONTEXT` - used to specify an optional context for the routes in the application

### The Config Namespace

The variables are populated in the `env` map that's found in the `<app>.config` namespace that looks as follows:

```clojure
(ns <app>.config
  (:require [cprop.core :refer [load-config]]
            [cprop.source :as source]
            [mount.core :refer [args defstate]]))

(defstate env :start (load-config
                       :merge
                       [(args)
                        (source/from-system-props)
                        (source/from-env)]))
```

The configuration will load the environment variables from the known sources and merge it with the
command line arguments populated by [clojure.tools.cli](https://github.com/clojure/tools.cli) in the
`<app>.core/start-app` function. The resulting configuration is a map that can be accessed
as seen in the example below:

```clojure
(ns <app>.db.core
  (:require [<app>.config :refer [env]]))

(def database-url
  (-> env :database :url))
```

## Environment Specific Code

Some code, such as development middleware for showing stacktraces in the browser, is dependent on the mode the application
runs in. For example, we'd only want to run the above middleware during development and not show stacktraces to the client
in production.

Luminus uses `env/dev/clj` and `env/prod/clj` source paths for this purpose. By default the source path will contain the
`<app>.env` namespace that has the environment specific configuration. The `dev` config looks as follows:

```clojure
(ns <project-ns>.env
  (:require [selmer.parser :as parser]
            [clojure.tools.logging :as log]
            [<project-ns>.dev-middleware :refer [wrap-dev]]))

(def defaults
  {:init
   (fn []
     (parser/cache-off!)
     (log/info "\n-=[app started successfully using the development profile]=-"))
   :middleware wrap-dev}
```

The config references the `<app>.dev-middleware` namespace found in the same source path. Any development specific middleware
should be placed there.

Meanwhile, the `prod` config will not 
 
```clojure
(ns <project-ns>.env
  (:require [clojure.tools.logging :as log]))

(def defaults
  {:init
   (fn []
     (log/info "\n-=[app started successfully]=-"))
   :middleware identity})
```

Only the middleware defined in the `<app>.middleware` namespace is run during production.

Luminus aims to provide solid defaults for creating your web application. As such it comes packaged with several
libraries by default. These libraries include 
[Buddy](https://github.com/funcool/buddy) for security, [Bouncer](https://github.com/leonardoborges/bouncer) for validation,
[Selmer](https://github.com/yogthos/Selmer) for HTML templating,
[Tower](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/tower) for internationalization and a few others.
Of course, there are many other Clojure libraires for web development. Here we are going 
to provide a list of Clojure and ClojureScript libraries which can be useful in addition 
to those already included with Luminus.

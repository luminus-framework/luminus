A typical workflow for developing Clojure applications is to connect the editor to a REPL running an instance
of the application. Luminus provides two ways to connect to the REPL.

# With Leiningen

## Starting the Application from the REPL

When you run the REPL in the project directory it will start in the `user` namespace located in the `env/dev/clj/user.clj` file. This namespace provides helper functions `start`, `stop`, and `restart` that are used to manage the state of the application components.

To start the HTTP server and any other components such as databases, run the `start` function:

```clojure
(start)
```

Run the following command to start the HTTP server:

```clojure
(mount/start #'<app>.core/http-server)
```

## Connecting to the nREPL

Luminus also provides an embedded [nREPL](https://github.com/clojure/tools.nrepl) that can be used to connect
the editor to a running instance of the server. A default nREPL port is set in `dev-config.edn` configuration file:

```clojure
{:dev true
 :port 3000
 ;; when :nrepl-port is set the application starts the nREPL server on load
 :nrepl-port 7000}
```

When you run your application using `lein run` it will create a network REPL on the port `7000` and you will be
able to connect your editor to it on `localhost:7000`. Note that when the `NREPL_PORT` environment variable is
set then nREPL will also be available in production and can be used to inspect the application the same way you would in development.

Please see the [deployment section](/docs/deployment.html#enabling_nrepl) for the instructions on enabling the nREPL for production.

# With Boot

## Starting the Application from the REPL

With Boot, running the HTTP server in the REPL requires a few extra steps. In the command line, run `boot dev repl` to start the REPL in the "dev" configuration. Then, in the REPL, run `(in-ns 'user)` followed by `(load "user")` to load the helper functions found in `env/dev/clj/user.clj`. Since you are already in the `user` namespace, you have immediate access to these functions. Now you can run `(start)` to run your application in the REPL.

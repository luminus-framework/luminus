ClojureScript is an excellent alternative to JavaScript for client side application logic. Some of the advantages of using ClojureScript include:

* use the same language on both the client and the server
* share common code between the front-end and back-end
* cleaner and more consistent language
* dependency management via Leiningen
* immutable data structures
* powerful standard library

### Adding ClojureScript Support

The easiest way to add ClojureScript support is by using the `+cljs` flag when making a new project. However, it's quite easy to add it to an existing project as well. First, add the `lein-cljsb-build` plugin and `:cljsbuild` key to the project as seen below:

```clojure
:plugins [... [lein-cljsbuild "1.0.3"]]  

:cljsbuild
{:builds {:app {:source-paths ["src-cljs"]
               :compiler {:output-to     "resources/public/js/app.js"
                          :output-dir    "resources/public/js/out"
                          :source-map    "resources/public/js/out.js.map"
                          :externs       ["react/externs/react.js"]
                          :optimizations :none
                          :pretty-print  true}}}}  
```

Next, update the `:uberjar` profile with the following options:

```clojure
:hooks ['leiningen.cljsbuild]
:cljsbuild {:jar true
            :builds {:app
                     {:compiler
                      {:optimizations :advanced
                       :pretty-print false}}}}
```

The above will add the [lein-cljsbuild](https://github.com/emezeske/lein-cljsbuild) hook to the `:uberjar` profile so that ClojureScript is compiled when `lein ring uberjar` is run. The `:cljsbuild` options will override the defaults with production settings.

All the ClojureScript namespaces should live in the `src-cljs` directory under the root of your project. Note that ClojureScript files **must** end with the `.cljs` extension. If the file ends with `.clj` it will still compile, but it will not have access to the `js` namespace.

### Using Libraries

One advantage of using ClojureScript is that it allows managing your client-side libraries using Leiningen. ClojureScript libraries are included under dependencies in the `project.clj` just like any other library.

### Running the Compiler

The easiest way to develop ClojureScript applications is to run the compiler in `auto` mode. This way any changes you make in your namespaces will be recompiled automatically and become immediately available on the page. To start the compiler in this mode simply run:

```
lein cljsbuild auto
```

Make sure to run the `clean` option before packaging the application for production using `lein ring uberjar`. This will ensure that any existing artifacts are removed before the production JavaScript is compiled:

```
lein cljsbuild once
```

### Advanced Compilation and Exports

During advanced compilation variable names will be munged by the compiler to shorten the code. If we wish to expose any functions to JavaScript we have to ensure that their names are protected. This is done by using the `^:export` annotation, eg:

```clojure
(ns main)

(defn ^:export init []
  (js/alert "hello world"))
```

We can now call this function from our page like any other:

```html
<script>
main.init();
</script>
``` 

If we use a Js library in our code we must protect the names of any functions we call from it as well. For example, if we wanted to use the [AlbumColors](https://github.com/chengyin/albumcolors) library, we could write the following:

```clojure
(defn ^:export init []  
  (.getColors (js/AlbumColors. "/img/foo.jpg") 
    (fn [[background]]
     (.log js/console background))))
```

However, when the script is compiled with the `:advanced` flag, the `AlbumColors` and `getColors` will be munged.

To protect them we have to create a Js file with the names we'd like to protect and reference it in our build: 

```javascript
var AlbumColors = {};
AlbumColors.getColors = function() {};
```

If we put the above code in a file called `externs.js` under the `resources` directory then we would reference it in our `cljsbuild` section as follows: 

```clojure
{:id "release"
 :source-paths ["src-cljs"]
 :compiler
 {:output-to "resources/public/js/app.js"
  :optimizations :advanced
  :pretty-print false
  :output-wrapper false
  ;;specify the externs file to protect function names
  :externs ["resources/externs.js"]
  :closure-warnings {:non-standard-jsdoc :off}}}
```

A useful site for extracting externs can be found [here](http://www.dotnetwise.com/Code/Externs/).

### Interacting with JavaScript

All the global JavaScript functions and variables are available via the `js` namespace.

#### Method Calls

```clojure
(.method object params)

(.log js/console "hello world!")
```

#### Accessing Properties

```clojure
(.-property object)

(.-style div)
``` 

#### Setting Properties

```clojure
(set! (.-property object))

(set! (.-color (.-style div) "#234567"))
```

For more examples of ClojureScript synonyms of common JavaScript operations see the [ClojureScript Synonyms](http://kanaka.github.io/clojurescript/web/synonym.html).

### Reagent

[Reagent](http://holmsand.github.io/reagent/) is the recommended approach for building ClojureScript applications with Luminus. Using the `+reagent` profile in Luminus will create an application with it configured. Consider also using `+re-frame` to add support with [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) to the project.

Reagent is backed by [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and provides an extremely efficient way to manipulate the DOM using [Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup) style syntax. In Reagent, each UI component is simply a data structure that represents a particular DOM element. By taking a DOM centric view of the UI, Reagent makes writing composable components simple and intuitive.

A simple Reagent component looks as follows:

```clojure
[:label "Hello World"]
```

Components can also be functions:

```clojure
(defn label [text]
  [:label text])
```

The values of the components are stored in Reagent atoms. These atoms behave just like regular Clojure atoms, except for one important property. When an atom is updated it causes any components that dereference it to be repainted. Let's take a look at an example.

**important** make sure that you require Reagent atom in the namespace, otherwise regular Clojure atoms will be used and components will not be repainted on change.

```clojure
(ns myapp
  (:require [reagent.core :as reagent :refer [atom]]))
  
(def state (atom nil))

(defn input-field [label-text]
  [:div
    [:label label-text]
    [:input {:type "text"
             :value @state
             :on-change #(reset! state (-> % .-target .-value))}]])
```

Above, the `input-field` component consists of a `label` component we defined earlier and an `:input` component. The input will update the `state` atom and render it as its value.

Notice that even though `label` is a function we're not calling it, but instead we're putting it in a vector. The reason for this is that we're specifying the component hierarchy. The components will be run by Reagent when they need to be rendered.

This is behavior makes it trivial to implements the [React Flux](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/flux-overview.html) pattern.

```
Views--->(actions) --> Dispatcher-->(callback)--> Stores---+
É…                                                          |
|                                                          V
+--(event handlers update)--(Stores emit "change" events)--+
```

Our view components dispatch updates to the atoms, which represent the stores. The atoms in turn notify any components that dereference them when their state changes.

In the previous example, we used a global atom to hold the state. While it's convenient for small applications this approach doesn't scale well. Fortunately, Reagent allows us to have localized states in our components. Let's take a look at how this works.

```clojure
(defn input-field [label-text id]
  (let [value (atom nil)]
    (fn []
      [:div
        [label "The value is: " @value]
        [:input {:type "text"
                 :value @value
                 :on-change #(reset! value (-> % .-target .-value))}]])))
```

All we have to do is create a local binding for the atom inside a closure. The returned function is what's going to be called by reagent when the value of the atom changes.

Finally, rendering components is accomplished by calling the `render-component` function:

```clojure
(defn render-simple []
  (reagent/render-component [input-field]
                            (.-body js/document))
```

A working sample project can be found [here](https://github.com/yogthos/reagent-example). For a real world application using Reagent see the [Yuggoth blog engine](https://github.com/yogthos/yuggoth).

### Client Side Routing

[Secretary](https://github.com/gf3/secretary) is the recommended ClojureScript routing library. It uses Compojure inspired syntax for route definitions. To use the library, We'll add the dependency to your project, if you created the project using the `+cljs` template then it will be included by default.

```clojure
[secretary "1.2.0"]
```

Next, we have to reference the library in our ClojureScript namespace to use it.

```clojure
(ns app
  (:require [secretary.core :as secretary
             :include-macros true
             :refer [defroute]]
            [goog.events :as events])
  (:import goog.History
           goog.history.EventType))
```

With the library imported we can create routes that will set the content of the specified DOM element when triggered.

```clojure
(defn home []
  [:div [:h1 "Home"]])

(defn info []
  [:div [:h1 "About this app"]])

(defn not-found []
  [:div [:h1 "404: Page doesn't exist"]])

(defn page [page-component]
  (reagent/render-component
    [page-component]
    (.getElementById js/document "appContainer")))
    
(defroute home-path "/" [] (page home))
(defroute home-path "/about" [] (page info))
(defroute "*" [] (page not-found))
```

Please refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/gf3/secretary) for further details.

### Working With the DOM directly

#### Warning

Since Reagent uses a virtual DOM and renders components as necessary, direct manipulation of the DOM is highly discouraged. Updating DOM elements outside the Reagent components can result in unpredictable behavior.

That said, there are several libraries available for accessing and modifying DOM elements. In particular, you may wish  to take a look at the [Domina](https://github.com/levand/domina) and [Dommy](https://github.com/Prismatic/dommy). Domina is a lightweight library for selecting and manipulating DOM elements as well as handling events. Dommy is a templating library similar to Hiccup.

### Ajax

Luminus uses [cljs-ajax](https://github.com/yogthos/cljs-ajax) for handling Ajax operations. The library provides an easy way to send Ajax queries to the server using `ajax-request`, `GET`, and `POST` functions.

#### ajax-request

The `ajax-request` is the base request function that accepts the following parameters:

* uri - the URI for the request
* method - a string representing the HTTP request type, eg: "PUT", "DELETE", etc.
* format - a keyword indicating the response format, can be either `:json` or `:edn`, defaults to `:edn`
* handler - success handler, a function that accepts the response as a single argument
* error-handler - error handler, a function that accepts a map representing the error with keys `:status and `:status-text`
* params - a map of params to be sent to the server

#### GET/POST helpers

The `GET` and `POST` helpers accept a URI followed by a map of options:

* `:handler` - the handler function for successful operation should accept a single parameter which is the deserialized response
* `:error-handler` - the handler function for errors, should accept a map with keys `:status` and `:status-text`
* `:format` - the format for the response `:edn` or `:json` defaults to `:edn`
* `:params` - a map of parameters that will be sent with the request


```clojure
(ns foo
  (:require [ajax.core :refer [GET POST]]))

(defn handler [response]
  (.log js/console (str response)))

(defn error-handler [{:keys [status status-text]}]
  (.log js/console 
    (str "something bad happened: " status " " status-text)))

(GET "/hello")

(GET "/hello" {:handler handler})

(POST "/hello")

(POST "/send-message" 
        {:params {:message "Hello World"
                  :user    "Bob"}
         :handler handler
         :error-handler error-handler})
```

## Internationalization

Luminius template comes with [Tower](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/tower) dependency which
provides you functionality for internationalization and
translation. You are able to use a ring middleware

```clojure
(def app (-> all-routes
             (middleware/app-handler)
             (taoensso.tower.ring/make-wrap-i18n-middleware)))
```

Or use `with-locale` macro to set up your locale explicitly:

```clojure
(with-locale :en (t :example/greeting "Steve")) => "Hello Steve, how are you?"
```

More information is available on the [Github](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/tower) page for the project.

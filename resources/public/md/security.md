## Security

Password hashing and comparison is provided via `noir.util.crypt` in [lib-noir](https://github.com/noir-clojure/lib-noir).

It provides two functions, $encrypt$ and $compare$. The first will encrypt and salt the password, 
while the second compares the raw password to the encrypted string generated by the first. BCrypt 
is used to do the actual encryption.

The signature for `compare` looks as follows:

```clojure
(compare raw encrypted)
```

The `encrypt` function allows specifying the salt, or it will generate one if it is none is provided:

```clojure
(encrypt salt raw)
(encrypt raw)
```

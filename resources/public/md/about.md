## About Luminus

Luminus is built on top of [Ring](https://github.com/mmcgrana/ring), [Compojure](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure), 
and [lib-noir](https://github.com/noir-clojure/lib-noir). These libraries provide the core functionality for building web applications. 
Luminus ties these libraries together to provide a simple and consistent environment.

Unlike traditional frameworks, Luminus leaves most decisions up to the user and does not enforce any one way of building applications.
Instead, it aims to provide good starting defaults via templates on top of which the rest of the application can be built.

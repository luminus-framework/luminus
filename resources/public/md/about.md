## About Luminus

Luminus is built on top of [Ring](https://github.com/mmcgrana/ring), [Compojure](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure),
and [lib-noir](https://github.com/noir-clojure/lib-noir). These libraries provide the core functionality for building web applications.
Luminus ties these libraries together to provide a simple and consistent environment.

Unlike traditional frameworks, Luminus leaves most decisions up to the user and does not enforce any one way of building applications.
It aims to provide good starting defaults via templates on top of which the rest of the application can be built.

### Luminus architecture

All the functionality on top of Ring and Compojure is provided via lib-noir. This library facilitates sessions,
validation, file uploads, and other common features. This is the core component of the framework.

The [luminus-template](https://github.com/yogthos/luminus-template) project provides a number of templates with basic configuration
already setup. For example, you can use a template to initialize an application with support for ClojureScript or an SQL database. 

The templates take care of generating the boilerplate code, allowing you to focus on writing your application. Of course, you can always
modify any code generated by the template as it's just part of your project.

It is the feeling of the authors that this model has some advantages over monolithic frameworks by being transparent and providing
added flexibility to the user. With Luminus it's trivial to swap out the libraries bundled by default or add extensions which make sense
for your application. 

The framework is being developed by [Dmitri Sotnikov](http://yogthos.net) and [Edward Tsech](http://about.me/edtsech).
